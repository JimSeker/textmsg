smsDemo is a simple app to send and receive sms messages.  The code has been tested on android 4.4 and it works.
  It does not attempt to be a default sms provider.  The sms are sent via an intent and the default will
   have a copy of the message as well, but the default provider doesn't have to user do anything.

smsDemo2 sends binary sms messages.  Untested in 4.4+

mmsDemo is a hack to send mms messages for prior to android 4.4.  Messenger comes up and the user
  is required to press the send button in order to make it work.
